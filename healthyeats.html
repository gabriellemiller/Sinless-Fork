    <h1>Let's Get Real</h1>
    <p>I don't want to sit here and try to brag about how I only eat healthy foods and I absolutely love to eat only spinach 
        for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Instead, I rather tell you that I have learned to mend my relationship with food and discover
        that I like to eat foods that are nutritious to my body because of the way they make me feel. I eat them because they are vital to our bodies,
        improve my overall health and well-being, and keep me satiated and full for longer.
    </p>
    <p>
        For me, it is super important to have protein and fiber in every meal in order to keep me full for long and supress my cravings. Also, prioritizing
        protein in every meal can help build lean muscle mass so get those GAINS!
    </p>
    <p>I have provided a couple YouTube videos that give quick healthy recipes for any time of the day. I am currently working on filming content of my own to share with
        you guys so stay tuned!
    </p>
    <h2>Easy 5-Ingredient Healthy Energy Bars</h2>
    <p>I find these bars so easy to make and are the perfect grab-and-go meal whenever you are rushing out of the house, need a snack, or need a pre-workout meal to give
        you a boost of energy. This snack is very tasty right out the fridge so I recommend storing them in the fridge rather than sitting in room temperature because they will last longer too!

    <h2>Best Oatmeal Recipe</h2>
    <p>Oatmeal is one of my all time favorite breakfast meals. They are incredibly nutritious, are rich in antioxidants, help improve blood sugar control, and are very filling and keep me full for hours! The list
        goes on and on. The recipe below is my go-to but there are endless toppings you can put on top of oatmeal that will give each a different personality. You could do peanut butter banana one day, frozen berries
        with honey another day, or even chocolate chips with strawberries on top the next day, the possibilities are endless!

    <h2>Egg White Muffin Meal-Prep</h2>
    <p>I wanted to provide you guys with this gem because this is perfect for when you know you have a busy week coming up. This recipe allows you to make many servings at once So all you have to do is just pop the muffins in 
        the microwave and serve them with a serving of carbs and a serving of healthy fats and your good to go! I like to have these muffins on the side of multigrain toast topped with avocado. That way, I'm getting 
        protein, carbs, and fats all in one meal!
