    <h1>Hello Hello Helloo!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Sineless Fork,</p>
    <p>A community that believes a healthy lifestyle means there is no finish line,
        rather it is an endless pursuit of striving to be the best versions of ourselves everyday.
        Change comes from the inside out and you will not acheive the best version of yourself
        until you believe that not every health journey looks the same! We acheive being the best versions
        of ourselves by finding BALANCE in our circle of life. Human beings have boundless potential to never stop
        growing and learning about themselves. Here we promote holistic living: which means prioritizing spirituality,
        joy, social life, relionships, physical activity, nutrition, health, and creativity all equally.
    </p>
    <p>Allow to introduce myself, hi! I'm Gaby. I am currently a student-athlete in college
        and my personal journey with food and well-being has not always been the healthiest. I have definitely had my ups and downs throughout my journey, been through almost every
        diet in the book and tried every workout activity out there. I always approached healthy eating and working out with a tunnel vision attitude,
        constantly focused on the finish line rather than the journey. I learned this the hard way, but I had to shift my perspective: I realized that I had to enjoy how working out 
        makes me feel and then I will benefit from the results, not the other way around. If we focus on results solely, we will never be satisfied,
        it truly is a never-ending uphill battle with yourself. We have to sotp focusing on the "big picture" and turn our eyes towards the tiny little victories we
        accomplish daily. In my mind, there is no such thing as an effective "quick fix", rather there is such thing is working towards building a holistic lifestyle.
    </p>
<p>
    That being said, this is where Sinless Fork came to be. I want to show you guys how to be okay with being perfectly imperfect. Some days we want to eat 
    really healthy and that's okay! Other days we want to satisfy our cravings... and that's okay! Listening to your body is the most
    healthy thing we can do as human beings. Taking steps towards a healthier lifestyle means building a healthy relationship with food, and that doesn't need to
    com with this "all or nothing" mentality. I intend to use this page to be transparant with you guys and show you guys the struggle that I go through outside of 
    social meadia, and hopefully we can all work together to becoming better day by day! Throughout my entire journey I have been able to learn and unlearn many things,
    but one thing has always stuck with me: the biggest differences towards overall health are made as a result of the little steps we take along the way.
    <p>
