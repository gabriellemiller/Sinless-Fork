    <h1>Everything BUT the Diet</h1>
    <p>I want to use this space to talk about all things that have to do with having a balanced and holistic lifestyle.</p>
    <h2>Why Sleep is So Important</h2>
    <p>Although I don't pratice this as often as I should, sleeping is vital for overall health. One thing is getting sleep, but getting restful sleep
        is a whoooole other thing. I have always stayed away from sleeping medications because I believe natural remedies work better in the long run. I also try to
        not use my phone an hour beofre bed, read a little to get my sleepy mode on, and cool down my sleeping area to make my sheets feel a little more cozy.
        Some natural remedies that I use are: lavender spray, chamomille tea, and a weighted blanket.
    </p>
    <h2> My Instant Mood Boosters</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we have happy days, and sometimes we have stressful days where we wish time would go slow. I have found that the simplest things can turn our moods upside 
        down in a matter of no time.
    </p>
    <h3>Play some music to wind down and destress
    </h3>
    <p>There is no thing that makes me happier than getting in the car alone, going on a drive, and blasting music till you can sing and can't hear your voice.
        I have linked my happy playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2DgpoVfv9s2FScWKYSqIfx?si=2lK0s5lWTG-BLU6794eNRw">here</a> and hope you can take a chance
        to listen to it on your next drive!
    </p>
    <h3>Connect with nature</h3>
    <p>Sometimes all we need to destress from a bad day is to disconnect from our phones and our overwhelming social media feeds and just need to go outside and breathe natural air to reconnect with ourselves.</p>
<p>Next time you're feeling a down or are looking for a little pick me up, I invite you to try these out. Above all, always remember that it's okay to have a bad day and that the bad days are what make us appreciate the good ones.</p>
