    <h1>Let's Get Sweating</h1>
    <p>I want to keep it blunt with you guys. When I am looking towards staying in shape and continuing to build lean muscle mass and cut fat, I workout first thing in the 
        morning 4-5 times a week. The reason I workout first thing in the morning is because your body continues to burn calories at a faster rate throughout the day. Also, I find my days much more productive when I 
        finish my workout early morning and have the rest of my day to do whatever I need, it makes me feel more energized. However, fitness and physical activity is only 10% of the battle. The main priority to 
        reaching the best version of you physical self is through proper nutrition. You will not make substantial progress until you corrcet that your relationship with food and know what your getting into.
    </p>
    <p>Yet, looking good is not the only reason I workout. I love to workout because it makes me feel better both mentally, and emotionally. It is a stress reliever for me to be able to plug in my headphones and disconnect from my hectic schedule
        for at least one hour everyday. Whether it be going on an outdoor run, stretching, weightlifting, a HIIT exercise, or even go for an outdoor walk, getting my body moving and sweating works wonders for me. It improves my overall health and mood.
    </p>
    <p>
        All in all, I urge you to keep this in mind: find a workout that makes YOU happy. That will adhere the best results. If you read online that cycling helps burn up to 600 calories per hour but you absolutely hate every 
        second of it, you will not last long doing it. FInd something that you enjoy and you'll not only be able to last longer doing it but you'll expend more energy as you're doing it.
