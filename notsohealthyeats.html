    <h1>Not So Healthy Eats!</h1>
    <h2>Now let's get to the fun stuff</h2>
    <p>
Of course, I will always say, "everything in moderation". But don't be afraid to enjoy foods that taste so good every now and then!
Personally, I can never go a week without satisfying my cravings. I think it's humanly impossible to surpress your cravings and never be able
to give in. Instead of thinking of satisfying your cravings by having a "cheat meal", think of it as having a "free meal". Psychological framing 
matters. ALLOW yourself to have a break every once in a while. If you want to have some icecream, do it! Don't feel bad about it. Enjoy it! One thing I 
ask while your thinking of what to it is: make sure it's worth it.
    </p>
    <p>At the end of the day, our main concern should be to maximize one's quality of life. Dieting and eating strictly is an admirable factor and undoubtedly 
        requires self discipline. However, although it is cliche, too much of a good thing could be a bad thing. Balance is everything.
    </p>
    <p>Down below I have provided recipes and YouTube videos of how to make some of my favorite meals that satisfy my sweet creavings. Hope you enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies Straight from Heaven Above</h3>
    <h4>These are said to be a copycat version of NYC's best chocolate chip cookie. I am a dessert fanatic and I for one can tell you that these half
        pound cookies are a staple in my house. I have come across countless chocolate chip cookie recipes in my life and I will always stand by this one.</h4>

            <p>*Levain Bakery has stated they don't use vanilla extract in their cookies. If you would like to add vanilla extract, I would suggest adding 1 teaspoon when adding the eggs to the batter.</p>

        <h3>Banana Bread that will make you go Bananas</h3>
    <h4>The best way to make use out of bananas that have passed their prime and there's nothing else to do but throw them out... make banana bread! This recipe
        is the yummiest most delicious recipe that will last for days! You could also put the bread in the freezer and pop it into the over when you want to serve it up again. Putting it
        in the freezer allows you to save the bread up to 3-4 weeks. I highly recommend getting creative and adding ingredients such as pecans, Nutella, and peanut butter!

        <h3>DIY Caramel Frappuccino</h3>
        <h4>This one's for all my coffee lovers who are ballin' on a budget! There's nothing worse than wanting to indulge yourself with a yummy coffee in the morning but know that it wouldn't make your wallet
            very happy. I came across this recipe a couple weeks ago and it has definitely come in handy! Tip: you can substitute the whole milk to any milk alternative you want and it will tast just as good! I 
            advise using oat milk or coconut milk to keep the creamy thick texture of the Frappuccino. Enjoy this yummy drink for breakfast, lunch, or dinner? Whatever floats your boat I can't tell you what to do.
